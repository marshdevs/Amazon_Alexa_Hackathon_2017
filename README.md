Lots of people love to cook; or rather, they say they love to cook. We, as humans, we love to design, to create; 
it’s in our nature. So why don’t more people actually cook?


The idea of cooking is romantic. In reality, it can cause a lot of consternation. When it comes to cooking, 
a significant portion of the mental overhead is deciding what you’re going to cook, when you’re going to cook it, 
and what you need to get the job done.


When you’re in the kitchen with Ramsay, you have none of these worries. Use Ramsay to plan your meals for the week! 
Just give him an ingredient, and he’ll suggest meals containing that ingredient for your entire week, so you don’t have
to choose what to cook. He’ll hear your preferences (and your objections), and build a meal plan just for you. 
Ramsay currently only accepts one ingredient, but he’s learning: soon he’ll be able to take in multiple ingredients
and build a meal plan that expands to cover all of your tastes.


Once you’re finished building, just ask him to read you back your meal plan, or what ingredients you’ll need. 
Ramsay (by integrating with DynamoDB) remembers your plan across sessions, so you can leave the room, forget what 
you’re cooking, come back, and ask him again.


Once you know what you’re eating, and you know what ingredients you need, you can determine what you have, and
what you need to buy. Ramsay is open to further integration, so he can be improved to link with your Amazon Fresh / 
PrimeNow accounts, to finish the job and fill your pantry with ease.
